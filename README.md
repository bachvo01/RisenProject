## Topic: Video Game Digital Distribution Service and Storefront Systen
The project is a prototype for an online store system and it is restricted within college
premises. This has been implemented under guidance of Dr. Huynh Trung Hieu. This
project is useful for customers to purchase games remotely. In addition, some businesses
which have the business model of retailing game codes, can apply the application for
e-commerce.

The application scope is to create a place to instantly provide activation code for customers without moving an inch from their chair. The system is based on a relational database with product purchase and management functions. Moreover, we hope to provide a
comfortable user experience alongside with the best pricing available.
